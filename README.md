Day 20 of #100daysofcode JAVASCRIPT EDITION

Javascript has always been a difficult concept for me to grasp on even after watching tons of videos and coding along.

Here i finally used the ForEach method effectively and boy was i happy it worked

This project showed me that my logical application in javascript programming is improving and I'm proud of it

DONT HESITATE TO MAKE CORRECTIONS, LIKE I SAID I'M STILL LEARNING
